    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>

    Write a file transfer program. To demonstrate, you'll need a client
    and a server program, doing the obvious.


    <ul>
      <li> The server awaits connections.
      </li><li> A client connects, and indicates the name of a file to
        upload or download.
      </li><li> The client sends or receives the file.
    </li></ul>
    <p>

    </p><p>
    Wherever applicable, use the commands and protocol for TFTP
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1350"> (IETF RFC
    1350)</a>, with the following modifications. You will need to
    design and use additional packet header information than that in
    TFTP; use the IETF
    2347 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2347"> TFTP Options
    Extension</a> when possible.
    </p><ul>
      <li> Use TCP-style sliding windows rather than the sequential
      acks used in TFTP. Test with at two different max window sizes.
      </li><li> Arrange that each session begins with a (random) number
        exchange to generate a key that is used for encrypting
        data. You can just use Xor to create key, or anything better.
      </li><li> Support only binary (octet) transmission.
      </li><li> Support a command line argument specifiying
      whether packets are IPv4 vs IPv6 UDP datagrams
      </li><li> Support a command line argument controlling whether
      to pretend to drop 1 percent of the packets; 
    </li></ul>
    
    Create a web page showing throughput across varying conditions: V4
    vs V6; different window sizes; drops vs no drops; upload vs
    download.
